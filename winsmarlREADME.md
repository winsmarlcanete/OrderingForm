Description:

My main contribution:
        
   Did the whole task 2 (Other members were having a hard time so I did the whole task).
   

What I Learned:

   Sometimes, it is okay to not handle everything 😁😁
         
               
Note:

   Our school did not sponsor GitHub nor recommended to us. I just suggested this to our group since it can enhance our productivity.
   Also, I have no idea how to deploy this. But I can be viewed via https://htmlpreview.github.io/ (Just paste the html link of the task).
